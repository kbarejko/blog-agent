## Introduction

This is a second test article created specifically to test the internal linking functionality. Internal linking is crucial for SEO and helps users discover related content on your blog.

## Testing Internal Links

When you have multiple articles in the same silo, the blog agent can automatically suggest and insert internal links between related articles. This improves:

- **SEO**: Search engines can better understand your content structure
- **User engagement**: Readers discover more relevant content
- **Site authority**: Internal linking distributes page authority across your site

## How It Works

The internal linking step:

1. Scans the same silo for related published articles
2. Uses AI to select 3-5 most relevant articles
3. Suggests natural anchor text from existing content
4. Inserts markdown links without adding new sentences

## Best Practices

For best results with internal linking:

- Keep articles in the same silo topically related
- Publish multiple articles before enabling internal linking
- Review AI-suggested links to ensure they're contextual
- Don't overlink - 3-5 links per article is optimal

## Conclusion

Automated internal linking saves time and improves your blog's SEO structure. With the blog agent's step 14, you can now automatically connect related articles within your silos.
